[Iterators and Iterables](https://www.agiliq.com/blog/2017/10/iterators-and-iterables/): Iterables are objects that implement the iterator protocol

[Generator](https://www.agiliq.com/blog/2017/11/how-python-generators-are-similar-iterators/):A Generator is a type of iterator which can be constructed natively inside a Python def function. A def function is a generator function if it contains any yield statements. And the immediate return value of calling such a function is a generator iterator, or just a generator. Generators require lesser lines of code than solving the problem with iterators and iterables.

[understand yield and yield from in Genrator](http://simeonvisser.com/posts/python-3-using-yield-from-in-generators-part-1.html):In Python a generator can be used to let a function return a list of values without having to store them all at once in memory.
